# Train-Scheduler

A small web application that demonstrates the use of a couple new technologies, including Google's Firebase real-time database, as well as DataTables, a JQuery table plugin that I have heavily modified its style through both CSS and the Datatables source code. The rest of the project is a typical stack of HTML/CSS/Javascript/JQuery.
